The Boulder Code&&Coffee started with a group of Rubyists that met at [The
Cup](http://thecupboulder.com) once a week. It soon outgrew it's original
meeting place, met at [dojo4](http://dojo4.com) for a few years and hung out at
[GitHub Boulder](http://github.com) for a while.

After a brief exile at [The Cup](http://www.thecupboulder.com/), we are
now meeting at [dojo4](http://dojo4.com) every Wednesday from 9AM to noon.
